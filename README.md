It can never really work, the best idea yet is to use bsp-to-godot then export to gltf then in blender prep for voxellizer, then write a converter script for that output and then sanitize the map in the Cube 2 editor to reduce voxel count.

However you would lose all bezier Patches all entities and any sort non-box-shape objects, so that is even more ugly than just losing Patches.
